-- Hi there! --

Thank you for downloading Desktop Cat!

You now have your own little virtual cat walking around your screen,
he is very customizable with 45 different cat types you can choose from.

You can customize your cat in the 'settings.ini' file inside of the 'config' directory,
provided with a readme.txt that shows you a list of cattypes you can select.
There are also a couple other settings which you can modify to your liking.




 :: Quick Note ::

When you try to run the executable your antivirus might block it, don't be scared if that happens,
you can just allow the program, or create an exception for it in your antivirus.
The program is compiled python, that's why the file is pretty big (sorry :P)

If you don't trust the provided binary, you can download and run from source instead:
